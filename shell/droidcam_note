If you are using the standard v4l2loopback module, close the droidcam client and any programs using v4l2loopback. Update the size parameter in ~/.config/droidcam using one of the sizes from step 2 below.
For DroidCam v4l2loopback-dc, you can change the webcam resolution as follows:

1. Close any programs using the droidcam webcam. Unload the device driver:
sudo rmmod v4l2loopback_dc

2. Re-load it with new options (WIDTH and HEIGHT are numbers). :
sudo insmod /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/media/video/v4l2loopback-dc.ko width=WIDTH height=HEIGHT

Standard sizes (Width x Height): 640×480, 960×720, 1280×720 (720p), 1920×1080 (1080p).

3. Restart the droidcam client to reload the settings, and test it out. You can keep changing the resolution.

4. Edit the text file /etc/modprobe.d/droidcam.conf with the new options to make the change stick.

It’s also possible to invert the video size (eg. 480×640, width=480 height=640), which will make the webcam vertical and rotate the video 90º. Not all programs may load the webcam with inverted parameters (eg. Discord does not) but many do (eg. Zoom and OBS).
