# An event loop is a programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. In Python, the most commonly used event loop is the asyncio module, which allows for asynchronous I/O and concurrency in a program.

# Here's an example that demonstrates the use of an event loop with asyncio:


import asyncio

async def hello_world():
    print("Hello")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("World")

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(hello_world())
loop.close()


# In this example, we define a coroutine function hello_world() that prints "Hello", waits for 1 second using asyncio.sleep(), and then prints "World". We then create an event loop using asyncio.get_event_loop() and run the hello_world() coroutine using loop.run_until_complete(). Finally, we close the event loop using loop.close().

# When we run this code, the event loop waits for the coroutine function hello_world() to complete before closing. The use of the async and await keywords allows for the asynchronous execution of the coroutine function, which means that other tasks can be executed while hello_world() is waiting for the sleep() function to complete.

# Here's another example that demonstrates the use of an event loop with multiple coroutines:


async def print_numbers():
    for i in range(10):
        print(i, end=" ")
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)

async def print_letters():
    for letter in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz":
        print(letter, end=" ")
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
tasks = [print_numbers(), print_letters()]
loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.gather(*tasks))
loop.close()


# In this example, we define two coroutine functions, print_numbers() and print_letters(), that print numbers and letters respectively with a short delay between each output. We then create an event loop, create a list of tasks that includes both coroutine functions, and run the tasks using asyncio.gather(). Finally, we close the event loop.

# When we run this code, the event loop runs both coroutine functions concurrently, with a short delay between each output. The asyncio.gather() function waits for both coroutine functions to complete before returning the final result.

# Overall, the asyncio module provides a powerful and efficient way to implement event loops and concurrency in Python programs.

# The event loop is a fundamental concept in Python's asyncio library, which provides support for writing concurrent and asynchronous code. The event loop is responsible for managing multiple tasks and ensuring that each task is executed in a cooperative manner.

# Here's an example of how to use an event loop in Python:


import asyncio

async def coro():
    print("Coroutine started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Coroutine finished")

async def main():
    print("Main started")
    await asyncio.gather(coro(), coro(), coro())
    print("Main finished")

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(main())
loop.close()



# In this example, we define a coroutine coro() that simply prints a message, sleeps for 1 second, and then prints another message. We also define a main() coroutine that starts three instances of coro() using asyncio.gather(), which waits for all the coroutines to finish before returning.

# We then create an event loop using asyncio.get_event_loop() and use it to run the main() coroutine using loop.run_until_complete(). Finally, we close the event loop using loop.close().

# When we run this code, the output will look like this:


# >> Main started
# >> Coroutine started
# >> Coroutine started
# >> Coroutine started
# >> Coroutine finished
# >> Coroutine finished
# >> Coroutine finished
# >> Main finished


# This demonstrates how the event loop is used to manage multiple coroutines in a cooperative manner. The event loop runs each coroutine until it reaches an await statement, at which point it suspends the coroutine and moves on to the next one. When the coroutine is ready to resume, the event loop resumes it from where it left off.

# The event loop is a powerful tool for writing concurrent and asynchronous code in Python. By using coroutines and the event loop, you can write code that is both efficient and easy to understand.
