# The Part of Speech

Every name is called a __noun__
As _field_ and _fountain, street_ and _town_.
In place of noun the __pronoun__ stands,
As _he_ and _she_ can clap their hands.

The __adjective__ describes a thing.
As _magic_ wand or _bridal_ ring.
The __verb__ means action, something done,
To _read_ and _write_, to _jump_ and _run_.

How things are done the __adverbs__ tell,
As _quick, slowly, badly, well_.
The __preposition__ shows relation,
As _in_ the street or _at_ the station.

__Conjuntions__ join, in many ways,
Sentences, words, _or_ phrase _and_ phrase.
The __interjection__ cries out, " _Hark_!
I need an exclamation mark!"
